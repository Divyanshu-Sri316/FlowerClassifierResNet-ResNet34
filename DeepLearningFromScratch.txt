Picking up a good dataset
-  Should not be a toy/standard dataset (MNIST, Titanic, CIFAR10)
-  Should be large enough (>1000 images)
-  Should have enough variety (should not be a straight forward problem)
-  It should be possible to build a good model
-  Should not be too large (<5 GB)
       -  Exception: pick a 10% or 1% samples
